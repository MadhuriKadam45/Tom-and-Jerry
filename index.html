            The Bide-a-wee Mouse Home sends two orphans over for a hike with
            Scoutmaster Jerry. Trouble is, the orphans, dressed as Indians, want
            to shoot arrows and tomahawk-chop everything in sight, and
            especially Tom, who quickly gets scalped and has the end of his tail
            chopped off. He captures Jerry; this, of course, means war, for
            which the tots paint dozens of badminton shuttlecocks as a fake
            army. They also paint a fierce face on the sleeping dog. Ultimately,
            they get Tom to leave a trail of gunpowder, which they light,
            destroying the garage. Tom signals a truce, and they all smoke a
            peace pipe, but the smoke comes out of Tom’s ears instead of his
            mouth.
